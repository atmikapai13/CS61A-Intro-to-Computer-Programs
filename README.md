# Introduction to Computer Programs
## Coursework for CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
  

*The CS 61 series at UC Berkeley is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view. CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms 
appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.*
